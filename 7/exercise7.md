## 1. Compare the two Computing Models: Mainframe and Cloud
### a. Mainframe computing:
- Centralized Computing: Mainframes are large, powerful computers used primarily by large organizations for critical applications, typically bulk data processing
- High Reliability and Security: Mainframes are known for their reliability, scalability and security. They support large-scale transaction processing
- Expensive and High Maintenance: High cost of hardware, software and maintenance. Requires specialized skills to manage
- Fixed Resources: Resources are fixed, and scaling up requires significant investment in new hardware

### b. Cloud computing:
- Decentralized and Distributed Computing: Utilizes distributed resources over the internet, providing on-demand access to computing resources like servers, storage and databases
- Elasticity and Scalability: Can quickly scale up or down based on demand, allowing business to pay only for what they use
- Cost-Effective: Reduces the need for upfront hardware investment and ongoing maintenance costs
- Broad Access: Provide access to a variety of services and applications from any location

### Reason for dramatic change:
- Cost efficiency
- Scalability and Flexibility
- Business Agility
